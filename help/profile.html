<header>vsftpd configuration profile</header>
These profiles allow for quick configuration of your vsftpd server, each profile
is targeted at a particular service type. When you selected a profile you can
fine-tune the profile by going to the manual configuration page.

<ul>
	<li>Standalone anonymous read-only service: vsftpd will not be started from
	inetd but will manage its own connections. Anonymous read-only is enabled,
	the root of the anonymous file area is configured to the home directory of 
	the user 'ftp'.</li>
	<li>Standalone virtual users: vsftpd will not be started from
	inetd but will manage its own connections and allows virtual users. All 
	virtual users are mapped to a UNIX user account called 'virtual' (make sure
	this account exists), the home directory of this user is the root of the file
	area.
</ul>
