<header>Manual configuration</header>
This page allows you to manage your vsftpd.conf file. Each option is explained
in further detail in the man page of vsftpd.<p>

You can select from one the following actions:
<ul>
	<li>Save changes: write the changes to the vsftpd.conf file</li>
	<li>Undo unsaved changes: reload the vsftpd.conf configuration without 
	saving current changes</li>
	<li>Rollback to previous version: before changes are saved a backup is made
	of the vsftpd.conf file, this option allows you to restore the backup</li>
</ul>
