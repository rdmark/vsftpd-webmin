<header>External configuration files</header>
This page allows you to manage additional configuration files that are referenced
from the main vsftpd configuration. The following files can be managed:

<ul>
	<li>Virtual users file: manages the virtual user accounts. Note: the accounts
	are only really removed or added after you pressed 'persist pending changes'.
	</li>
	<li>Allowed/Denied users list: the local users that are denied or allowed to
	login. The behavior depends on the configuration option "Deny users access 
	by default except in list". When enabled the listed users are allowed to 
	login otherwise they are denied. (only enforced if option is enabled)</li>
	<li>Banned email lists: these email addresses are banned from being used
	for anonymous passwords (only enforced if option is enabled) </li>
	<li>Restricted users list: the local users in this list are restricted to
	their own home directory, or are allowed to leave their home directory 
	(behavior depends on settings the main configuration file)</li>
	<li>Allowed email addresses list: only these email addresses are accepted
	for anonymous password (only enforced if option is enabled)</li>
</ul>
